# [Elo-based Team Splitter](https://teamsplitter.surge.sh)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/goto-bus-stop/elo-team-splitter.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Attempts to form two somewhat equal teams based on player Elo ratings. Mostly
intended for Age of Empires 2 community games, but it probably works for other
stuff too.
